# WebAppDev2CA2
A Front End Web App made with Vue to work in cooperation with a back end node server which accesses a MongoDB instance.

Run through NPM in Webstorm.
While the back end is running on Localhost:3000, interaction with the MongoDB instance will occur. If this is not the case, no data from it will be displayed.

Only validated to prevent empty inputs at the moment!
